# Two-Party-Deposit-and-Payment-Contract-Alice-Bob-
This contract requires Alice to first deposit 1000 units. After she does, Bob must deposit 500 units. Once both deposits are made, the contract automatically pays Bob 1000 units from Alice’s account and then closes. If either party fails to deposit before the deadline, the contract ends without executing the payment.
